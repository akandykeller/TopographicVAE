# Topographic Variational Autoencoder

*Paper*: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01394

## Getting Started
#### Install requirements with Anaconda:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### Activate the conda environment
`conda activate tvae`

#### Install the tvae package
Install the tvae package inside of your conda environment. This allows you to run experiments with the `tvae` command. At the root of the project directory run (using your environment's pip):
`pip3 install -e .`

If you need help finding your environment's pip, try `which python`, which should point you to a directory such as `.../anaconda3/envs/tvae/bin/` where it will be located.

#### (Optional) Setup Weights & Biases:
This repository uses Weight & Biases for experiment tracking. By deafult this is set to off. However, if you would like to use this (highly recommended!) functionality, all you have to do is set `'wandb_on': True` in the experiment config, and set your account's project and entity names in the `tvae/utils/logging.py` file.

For more information on making a Weight & Biases account see [(creating a weights and biases account)](https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true) and the associated [quickstart guide](https://docs.wandb.com/quickstart).

## Running an experiment
To rerun the experiment from Figure 3, you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_2d_mnist`

To rerun the experiments from Figure 4, you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_mnist`
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_dsprites`

To rerun the experiments from Tables 1, you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_Lhalf_mnist`
- `tvae --name tvae_Lshort_mnist`
- `tvae --name bubbles_mnist`
- `tvae --name tvae_L0_mnist`
- `tvae --name nontvae_mnist`

To rerun the experiments from Tables 2, you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_Lhalf_dsprites`
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_dsprites`
- `tvae --name tvae_Lshort_dsprites`
- `tvae --name bubbles_dsprites`
- `tvae --name tvae_L0_dsprites`
- `tvae --name nontvae_dsprites`

To rerun the generalization experiment described in Section B.4 (resulting in Figures 1 and 6), you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_mnist_generalization`

To rerun the experiments from Figures 22 and 23 (training on complex combined transformations), you can run:
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_perspective_mnist`
- `tvae --name tvae_Lpartial_rotcolor_mnist`

## Basics of the framework
- All models are built using the `TVAE` module (see `tvae/containers/tvae.py`) which requires a z-encoder, a u-encoder, a decoder, and a 'grouper'. The grouper module defines the topographic structure of the latent space through a `model` (equivalent to W in the paper), and a `padder` which defines the boundary conditions.
- All experiments can be found in `tvae/experiments/`, and begin with the model specification, followed by the experiment config where important values such as L (`group_kernel`) and K (`n_off_diag`) can be set. 


#### Model Architecutre Options
- `'n_caps'`: *int*, Number of independnt capsules
- `'cap_dim'`: *int*, Size of each capsule
- `'n_transforms'`: *int*, Length of the total transformation sequence (denoted S in the paper)
- `'mu_init'`: *int*, Initalization value for mu parameter
- `'n_off_diag'`: *int*, determines the spatial extent of the grouping within a single timestep (denoted K in the paper), `n_off_diag=1` gives K=3, while `n_off_diag=0` gives K=1.
- `'group_kernel'`: *tuple of int*, defines the size of the kernel used by the grouper, exact definition and relationship to W varies for each experiment.

#### Training Options
- `'wandb_on'`: *bool*, if True, use weights & biases logging
- `'lr'`: *float*, learning rate
- `'momentum'`: *float*, standard momentum used in SGD
- `'max_epochs'`: *int*, total training epochs
- `'eval_epochs'`: *int*, epochs between evaluation on the test (for MNIST)
- `'batch_size'`: *int*, number of samples per batch
- `'n_is_samples'`: *int*, number of importance samples when computing the log-likelihood on MNIST.
- `'max_transform_len'`: *int*, (for dSprites) controls the subset of the dataset
